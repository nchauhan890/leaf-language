# leaf-language

#### A simple lexer + parser + interpreter for a custom programming langauge called Leaf

Based off the [Let's Build a Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) series by **Ruslan Spivak**
and adapted + extended for Leaf.
Thanks to [Ruslan](https://github.com/rspivak/) for a great introduction to writing lexers/parsers/interpreters.
